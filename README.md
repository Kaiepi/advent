# Raku Advent Calendar

Since 2009 the Raku (formerly called Perl 6)  project has hosted an annual Advent event, in
the spirit of Perl and other projects, consisting of daily articles
starting on 1 December and ending on 25 December.

[Perl 6 Advent Calendar blog](https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/); from 2019 on, new articles will be published in the [Raku Advent Calendar blog](https://rakuadventcalendar.wordpress.com/).

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed instructions for
authors.

The current year's schedule is in file
