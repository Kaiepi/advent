# Raku Advent Calendar

Since 2009 the Raku (formerly called Perl 6)  project has hosted an annual Advent event, in
the spirit of Perl and other projects, consisting of daily articles
starting on 1 December and ending on 25 December.

Articles up to 2018 can be found in the 
[Perl 6 Advent Calendar blog](https://perl6advent.wordpress.com/); from 2019 on, new articles will be published in the [Raku Advent Calendar blog](https://raku-advent.blog/).

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for detailed instructions for
authors.

The current year's list of authors is in the file
[raku-advent-2020/authors.md](raku-advent-2021/authors.md). Add
yourself to the list via [pull request](/Raku/advent/pulls), and
