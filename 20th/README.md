# 20th anniversary article authors.

	Every article will pick one (or several) RFCs from [here](https://raku.org/archive/rfc/by-group.html), pay homage to the author, and write up a short example or examples of how they ended up being implemented in current day Raku. 
	
	You can also choose some that weren't implemented, and what happened to them. The emphasis is on people that helped craft Raku the way it is now, and how the process was democratic and inclusive.

In principle, commiting yourself to a day is not necessary, but I would need to have articles around Aug 1st so that we can publish them.
