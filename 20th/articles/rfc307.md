# RFC 307: PRAYER - what gets said when you bless something by Simon Cozens

In a context with apocalypses and exegeses, no wonder there's also a
PRAYER somewhere: precisely in this [RFC
307](https://raku.org/archive/rfc/307.html), by Simon Cozens, which
was actually *rejected*, but somehow ended up anyway in [Apocalypse
12](https://raku.org/archive/doc/design/apo/A12.html) together with
the one it that superseded it, [RFC
189](https://raku.org/archive/rfc/189.html). Both proposals talk about
what is going ot happen when an object is created, an action that has
traditionally been called [*blessing*](https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/bless.html) in the Perl world.

So let's get first to the rejected one, which is simpler. It says

> This RFC proposes a special sub, PRAYER, which is automatically
> called on blessing.

The term *blessing* is Perlese for welcoming a data structure into the
object world. In Perl
[objects are little more than hashes with a tag tacked on
them](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlobj.html), so you *bless* a data
structure with the class it's going to belong to. However, that's
pretty static, and it's only sticking together two pieces of data:

```
my %foo = bless { bar => "baz" }, "Foo";
say %foo; # Foo=HASH(0x1b05558)
```

Not even a formal definition of a package (again, Perlese for classes)
or attributes or whatever are needed. But imagine we need to ensure
the data structure includes a certain attribute, or need to create an
additional one from existing attribute values. Well, use one of the
existing object orientation packages such as
[Moo](https://metacpan.org/pod/Moo). [Moose](https://metacpan.org/pod/Moose#blessed)
even has per-attribute triggers, that can be used to check them once
they have been set. But really not an object-wide C<PRAYER>.

So we really need one. And we need one WITH CAPITAL LETTERS because
  that's how we call the IMPORTANT things, or actually the things that
  happen under the hood when we do something. Perl already does have a
  few of
  those. [`UNIVERSAL`](https://perldoc.perl.org/perlobj.html#The-UNIVERSAL-Class)
  is the ur-class (we call it [`Mu`](https://docs.raku.org/type/Mu) in
  Raku). That class includes `DOES` and `VERSION`; there's also
  `AUTOLOAD` which is called when a method does not exist in a class,
  as well as `DESTROY`.

> Other RFCs, recently commented, proposed other seudo-classes that
  used capital leters:
  [`NEXT`](https://raku-advent.blog/2020/08/14/rfc-190-by-damian-conway-next-pseudoclass-for-method-redispatch/),
  for instance.

This last method is interesting: it's called at a certain *phase* in
  the object lifecycle; at the very end of it, namely.

> Ob-pun about the mixed metaphor of objects starting their life with
>  a blessing and ending with simple destruction.

So Perl had a single
  [*phaser*](https://docs.raku.org/language/phasers). This RFC
  advocated for getting, at least, a couple of symmetric ones, at both
  ends of the object lifecycle. Which
  was precisely in the turf of [RFC
  189](https://raku.org/archive/rfc/189.html), which proposed a set of
  hierarchical `BUILD` (lost chance to call them `INCEPT`) and
  `DESTROY` calls, invoked up and down the object inheritance chain.

Which is why this RFC was rejected, I guess. However, this RFC goes a little beyond that, or sideways from that, so it
  made sense to pick it up for the apocalypsis 12, instead of
  subsuming it into 189. In a way, `BUILD` is what it asks for off the
  bat: it's the "prayer" that gets called from `bless`. But rephrase
  it slightly, "what's called when something *has been blessed*" and it
  becomes something totally different: not a building routine, but a,
  wait for it, *tweaking* routine (or method, or *submethod*, which is
  what it eventually became).

In this way, Raku got
  [`TWEAK`](https://docs.raku.org/language/objects#index-entry-TWEAK). RFC
  189 begat BUILD, which creates a nice and bundled object. But
  *after* this object has been created, and it's solidly wrapped into a
  `self` data structure, you might still need to `TWEAK` it, and do
  stuff that can only be done when and if the object is already
  BUILT. This is what TWEAK is for. And it can be put to good use in
  cases like [checking if the constructor has been called with an
  unexisting attribute](https://stackoverflow.com/a/47954584/891440)
  (which uses the `self` variable to grab all existing attributes), or
  to register `self` with some external object, or, actually, anything
  you might want to do with an object that has been aready blessed.

This also says something about the process that created Raku; an RFC that was rejected
  eventually ended up as an useful, and interesting, feature of the final
  language. Because, in the true open source spirit, with many eyes
  all bugs are shallow, and also many eyes look stuff all over again
  and find its real worth and meaning. Which is what you need when
  designing a 100 year language, I guess.
